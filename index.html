      	<p><strong>Confucius</strong> was one of the most influential philosophers in Chinese history. Before he went famous, he was known by his own name, <em>Kong Qiu</em>. Confucius lived during the Spring and Autumn period (appapproximately 771 to 476 BC). By then, China was not unified as a whole; instead, there were many states, large or small. The region Confucius came from was called <em>Lu Guo</em> (State of Lu), which is Shandong Province in China nowadays. Life of Confucius was not easy. In fact, he was a man with wisdom but he did not gain much favors by the state lords. He traveled state by state, and he gradually received reputation by the end of his life, and his daily sayings were quoted by his students, compiled and annotated into <em>The Analects</em>, one of the most influential classics for the Chinese people from thousand years ago to nowadays.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>As is well-known that Confucius is the founder of <strong>Confucianism</strong> which was the national theory of China for more than 1500 years, and it was stopped as being the national theory after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Notwithstanding, Confucius' contribution still cannot be forgotten since he settled the foundation of the identity of Chinese.</p>
